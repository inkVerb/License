<p align="center">NOTE: THIS IS IN BETA STAGE AND IS NOT YET READY FOR RELEASE.</p>
<p align="center">INK VERB LICENSE 1.0</p>
<p align="center">(IVL1.0 or inkVerb License 1.0)</p>
<br />
<br />
<p align="center">Plain-English Purpose</p>
<p align="center">You may use this Logo or the text of the Brand as a social media label, indicating the Service it represents, following the rules of that social media Service, not changing the Logo's shape or color except to monochrome, in a way that other people know what you're doing without explanation, and you don't need to use the TM or SM or &reg; when you use it.</p>
<p align="center">This is the basic "spirit of this License" and the Technical Rules of this license, below, fall within this intent.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p align="center">Technical Rules of this License, Sections I through V</p>
<p>I. Terminology</p>
<p>"The Owner" refers to the owner of the intellectual property being licensed.</p>
<p>"The Client" refers to the entity displaying the intellectual property. The Client may include both the owner of the Client's intellectual property and third parties of contract work, such as web development or graphic design or other contracted talent hired by the Client related to use of the Logo under this license.</p>
<p>"The Logo" refers to intellectual property, licensed and owned by the Owner, used to identify the brand without the text of the brand name being identified.</p>
<p>"The Brand" refers to the brand owned by the Owner whom the licensed Logo identifies.</p>
<p>"The License" refers to this license agreement in its entirety.</p>
<p>"Account" refers to an account or profile or folio or blog or "landing page" or something of a similar nature that the Owner has licensed to the Client under the Brand. An Account usually takes a web addressed in a form similar to: inkisaverb.com/theaccount or theaccount.inkisaverb.com, where inkisaverb.com would be the Brand and theaccount is the Account's Username.</p>
<p>"Username" refers to a set of characters that identifies the Client's unique Account to the public which can be included as part of a URL linking to the Client's display of the Account to the public.</p>
<p>"URL" refers to a web address, beginning with "http://" that points to a web page that can be viewed by the public. In reference to an "Account", an "Account URL" or "URL for the/an Account" points to the publicly viewable web address for the Account.</p>
<p>"Service" refers to the services and web product available to the Client through an Account from the Brand.</p>
<p>"Activating" in reference to a link or URL involves a clickable link, such as where mouse-clicking, finger-tapping, or comparable action would attempt to take the computer or device user to a location on a the web or initiate some activity relating to a Service.</p>
<p>"Extra Branding Guidelines" refer to any rules and permissions from the Owner relating to the Logo used by the Brand that the Owner requests or requires the Client to abide by, such as may include, but not be limited to, color, size, proportion, image cropping, relation to other content, et cetera.</p>
<p>This License may be indicated via entire text, other arbitrary text and URL link, or in the following two formats:  "IVL1.0" or "inkVerb License 1.0" (quotes not necessary)</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>II. Scope of License</p>
<p>A. The Logo is licensed to anyone seeking to display the Logo in association with an Account.</p>
<p>B. The Logo remains the intellectual property of the Owner and no rights or privileges are waived.</p>
<p>C. The Client may use the Logo in a recognizable manner to identify a "Username",</p>
<p>1) whether in the form of a URL or only the Username itself (with or without a preceding at @ symbol for the Username's use with the Service) in readable text,</p>
<p>2) if Activating the Logo would connect to an Account URL offered by the Brand, or</p>
<p>3) accompanied by a QR Code or other code containing the URL for the Account.</p>
<p>D. The Client may use the Logo for "sharing" purposes, such as a display of the Logo would Activate a Service for the Brand, commonly referred to as "sharing" digital content with, via, or on the Account holder's available options via the Service.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>III. Special Conditions of the License</p>
<p>A. The Client must abide by any and all laws and conditions of intellectual property rights retained by the Owner.</p>
<p>B. The Owner will make Extra Branding Guidelines or any other special restrictions  governing the use of the Logo available to the public via any means, but including a URL containing the same domain as the Service relating to the Logo. For example, where inkisaverb.com is the domain for the Service, Extra Branding Guidelines may be available at dev.inkisaverb.com or branding.inkisaverb.com or anyothertextatall.inkisaverb.com or inkisaverb.com/branding or inkisaverb.com/dev or inkisaverb.com/anyothertextatall or any other URL, no matter how related unrelated text may seem in opinion. But, these guidelines will be available via information from the Service, such as small clickable links in the "footer" section, via searching the website of the Service or Brand's web page, or using search engines, such as Google or Yahoo or any other may "crawl" and find the Extra Branding Guidelines of the Owner's Logo for the Brand. While the Owner may take these or any other method to make any Extra Branding Guidelines available to the public, having Extra Branding Guidelines is not a requirement of this License, the Owner may make those Extra Branding Guidelines available in whatever manner the Owner finds best, and it remains the Client's responsibility to seek out and abide by any Extra Branding Guidelines.</p>
<p>C. The Owner may, but is not required to, display a URL for any Extra Branding Guidelines in relation to text with this license. If the Owner uses this format, below, then the Owner is indicating</p>
<p>1) that there are indeed Extra Branding Guidelines and</p>
<p>2) where those Extra Branding Guidelines are located via Internet</p>
<p>thereby further diminishing any confusion. Either of the following two formats may be as follows to indicate this license with where Extra Branding Guidelines may be found at branding.inkisaverb.com:</p>
<p align="center">IVL1.0  branding.inkisaverb.com</p>
<p align="center">or<p>
<p align="center">inkVerb License 1.0 branding.inkisaverb.com</p>
<p>4) An example of licensing could use many understandable forms, but could also include forms such as:</p>
<p align="center">[LOGO] and "Ourlogo" are licensed under IVL1.0 brand.inkisaverb.com</p>
<p align="center">or</p>
<p align="center">if arranged in a chart or "table" in an area that provides "information",</p>
<p align="center">possibly by location-based association, as follows:</p>
<p align="center">Graphic: [LOGO]</p>
<p align="center">Text: "Ourlogo"</p>
<p align="center">License: IVL1.0</p>
<p align="center">Notes: brand.inkisaverb.com</p>
<p align="center">or other ways that clearly identify related information.</p>
<p>D. The Owner may change or rescind or otherwise alter this License at any time with or without notice. While some "grandfather" and "goodwill effort" principles apply to both general notice made available to the public by the Owner and compliance to those changes on behalf of the Client, Licensing this Logo shall not be construed to permanently or indefinitely bind the Owner and changes to the License shall not be grounds for immediate indictment of the Client.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>IV. Special Uses of the License</p>
<p>On all conditions of this License, and with no rights waived with or without this  License, the Client may use the Logo being licensed by the Owner on the following conditions:</p>
<p>A. The Logo must appear along side other such logos, that could but do not necessarily need to be licensed under this License. This may be known as and by, understood as and by, and referred to as and by "like-manner" display of "like-kind" logos of "like-kind" or "peer" or "competitor" services. While "like-kind" may be governed by other terms and laws, the primary determining factor of whether another Brand or Service or Logo is "like-kind" for the purpose(s) of this License is whether that Brand's Logo could be licensed under this License, whether it is actually so licensed or not. The Logo must be displayed among other "like-kind" logos and in "like-manner", with "like-manner" including the following:</p>
<p>1) These logos may appear in a line or cluster or multi-row spread or some other recognizable grouping of logos, as long as no rules of branding are violated.</p>
<p>2) Any allowable modifications to the logos' colors must be recognizably uniform, such as a single tone of color for all logos, two color tones for all logos, or all logos appearing in original colors, at this, only as allowable under individual rules of branding.</p>
<p>3) Any modifications to the logos' surroundings must be recognizably uniform, such as including logos inside of a single basic shape, such as a circle or square or rectangle with round corners or other uniform shapes allowed under law.</p>
<p>4) Any modifications to the logos involving what may be considered a "reversal" of what PNG images refer to as an "alpha channel" or "transparency" in an image file, as allowed under rules that may be governed by Extra Branding Guidelines, must be uniform across all other logos. What this may refer to as "alpha channel reversal" could use certain intellectual property -defined shape(s) of the Logo or logos and, change surrounding "alpha channel" content to a single color and change the single color version of the Logo or logos to "alpha" content.</p>
<p>5) Any modifications may not include: multiple basic shapes surrounding logos, such as a circle around one logo, a triangle around another, and a square around another. Nor may logos vary in multiple altered colors except original colors as licensed by each individual logo's guidelines that may be governed by Extra Branding Guidelines, with or without this License. Any modifications must remain uniform in both special surrounding shape and the same single-tone or two-tone colors and the same manner of "reversals" of the logos, such as inverting single-tone or two-tone colors.</p>
<p>6) Where the Logo does not appear alongside or otherwise among other "like-kind" logos, the Logo may appear in a location or as an "Activate" -ready function, such as "my favorite sharing Service/Account" or "my most recent Sharing/Account service" inside an application or service owned or provided by the Client. This must occur in such a way that the user of the Client's service or software or application clearly indicates that the Logo could be replaced by other "like-kind" logos in "like-manner" and, in no way, would seem to indicate that the Client's service or software or application would pretend to have ownership of the Logo or Brand.</p>
<p>B. If any branding rules or rules that could be governed by Extra Branding Guidelines for a logo used by the Client, but where that logo in question is not owned by the Owner, then the Owner shall have no legal standing for this License to have been violated concerning the Owner's Logo being licensed under this License. The Owner shall only have legal standing concerning any violations relating to a Logo or intellectual property owned by the Owner. For example, if the Owner's Branded Logo is "AB" and the Client displays the Logo for "AB" alongside another logo for the "BC" brand, and the Client has violated some intellectual property branding guidelines for displaying the "BC" logo, but has not violated any intellectual property branding guidelines for displaying the "AB" Logo, then only the owner of the "BC" logo has legal standing and the Owner of the "AB" Logo may not construe any arising situation to grant the Owner of the "AB" Logo so as that the Owner might have legal standing; however, this comes with an exception that, in such a situation, the Owner may deny use of its Logo to any Client at any time and for any reason or for no reason at all. In this, among any other rights the Owner maintains regardlessly, and while a Client's violation of a "BC" logo does in and of itself grand legal standing to legal use of the "AB" Logo, it is well within the scope of this License for the Owner to contact the Client with a message including words to the effect of, "While you have displayed our Logo in compliance with our own licensing and rules, you have not followed licensing and rules concerning other intellectual property with like-kind logos on your website and we, the Owner, request that you comply with rules concerning other intellectual property or else we specifically deny you use of our Logo."</p>
<p>C. The graphic Logo, but also an intellectual property -protected text version of the Brand, may also be governed by this License, with any case-sensitive restrictions inherently applying in the display of the text when Licsensed, notwithstanding that "ALL-CAPS" forms are also acceptable. For example, where inkVerb may be a Brand of a Service, a Logo for inkVerb may be governed by the license, but also the text "inkVerb" may be Licensed, meaning that both the Logo could be used, but also "inkVerb" or "INKVERB", in these to letter-case forms, would be so Licensed.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>V. Special Uses of the License</p>
<p>A. On condition that all applicable conditions and terms of this License are complied with, the Client may use the Logo without including a TM or SM or &reg; indicator, used to indicate Trademark or Registered Trademark or Servicemark or Registered Servicemark.</p>
<p>B. The Owner retains all rights to the Logo and allowing use of the Logo without intellectual property indicators including, but not limited to TM or SM or &reg; shall in no way be construed as any waiver of the Owner's rights.</p>
<p>C. This allowed exception, to not require the use of TM or SM or &reg; indicators only applies under the terms of this License, but the Owner still may require the use of TM or SM or &reg; indicators in situations not governed by this License.</p>
